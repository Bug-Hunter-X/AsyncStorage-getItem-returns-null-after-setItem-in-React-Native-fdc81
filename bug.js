This React Native bug manifests when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  Specifically, the issue arises when attempting to access data immediately after setting it.  The `getItem` method returns `null` even though the `setItem` method appears to have completed successfully. This is inconsistent behavior, as it should return the stored value. The problem seems isolated to situations where multiple setItem calls are made in quick succession, suggesting a potential race condition or asynchronous handling issue within AsyncStorage itself.
